# WishList

I always hate when people gift me something that I already have or something that I absolutely hate. It is an issue for both me and the one who gifts me. So I ended up creating a wishlist page. The following are the list of stuffs that I wanted to buy that has been sleeping on my WishList for so long. If you wanted to gift me on my birthday, or wanted to make me happy on a random day, feel free to use this. I'll update this page very often.
